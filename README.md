# Personal Website
Using AngularJS

## Synopsis

This is the code for my personal website, which I built using AngularJS.  While a bit overkill to use Angular for my personal site, it's been fun and quick to implement. Furthermore, I wanted something that was all my own code, so the only source that's not my own is the angular.js file

## Files

* **index.html:** Main page
* **style.css:** Custom styles
* **main.js:** JavaScript file that contains all the functionality for the site
* **angular.js:** AngularJS framework
